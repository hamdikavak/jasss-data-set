# jasss-dataset
This tool downloads and organizes articles published in open journal called "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation"

The tool will generate 962 files (one per article) in XML format. The articles are in one of these categories: peer reviewed, forum, and book reviews.

Based on my quick search, I found that eight articles in the dataset did not have a content. That is due to inconsistent formatting in JASSS. I manually added the content for those articles. 

I will not publicly provide the dataset here unless I get approval from JASSS editorial. You can always email me if you want to obtain the dataset.

Jar file is added.
